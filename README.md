## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree project. This project uses CRISP-DM Process to analyze the data related to courier sales for parcel delivery accross Nigerian cities. Using this data we will try to find answers to some of the interesting question that can give us some insight in a business point of view.

1. What period has the most number of shipment picked up ?
2. What are the top city with the highest number of sales ?
3. What service is mostly sold ?
3. Which city has the highest number of deliveries represented ?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The following are the files used in the project.
